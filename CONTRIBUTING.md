## Purpose

Thank you for considering a contribution! This guide explains how to report issues, propose changes, and submit pull requests so everything runs smoothly.

## Getting started

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from main (for example, feature/my-change).
- Set up the project locally following the steps in README.adoc.
- Make small, focused changes rather than large, mixed updates.

## How to report issues

- Search existing issues to see if your problem or idea is already tracked?
- When opening a new issue, include:
  - Clear summary and steps to reproduce.
  - Expected vs actual behavior.
  - Environment details (OS, language/runtime versions, etc.).

## How to propose changes

- For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss the idea before coding.
- Describe motivation, alternatives considered, and potential impact on existing users.
- Keep the scope of each pull request small and focused on a single concern.

## Coding standards

- Follow the existing code style; match formatting, naming, and patterns already in the codebase / datasets.
  - Follow the format specified for Number triangle datasets, as saved by the NTA2 app.
  - If your dataset fails to load in NTA2? It will need further revision, to accept.

- Add or update tests to cover your changes when applicable.
- Ensure the test suite and linters pass before opening a pull request.

## Pull request process

- Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against the main branch of this repository.
- Use a clear title and describe:
  - What changed?
  - Why it changed?
  - Any limitations or follow‑up work?
- Be open to review feedback; updates may be requested before merge.

## Community and conduct

- Be respectful, constructive, and welcoming to all contributors.
- By participating, you agree to follow this project’s Code of Conduct (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md if present).
