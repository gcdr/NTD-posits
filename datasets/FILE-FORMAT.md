## Details

* It is essentially very simple. There are 78 elements in a 12 column and 12 row number triangle. These are the entries in:

~~~
1 :1
1 :2
1 :3
1 :4
2 :5
1 :6
1 :7
3 :8
3 :9
1 :10
~~~

* See. The top of Pascal's triangle is there.
* The remaining elements 79 to 99 are the entries allowing filling of extra RSD (Rising Shallow Diagonal) elements. Shown in the picture below.
