## Number Triangle Editor Application

If you have discovered this repository. You are probably wondering. What is it for?

These are Number Triangle datasets.

Located in `common` are the common Number triangles. Most are found on [OEIS.org](https://oeis.org/) or all. Pascal's, Catalan's, and others.

## NTA2

Is there a Number triangle application? • Yes, there is.

Is it done and complete? • Yes, it is.

Why isn't it here? • Because, I am writing a paper on special Number triangles found with it.

* What is it called? NTA2 for Number Triangle Application 2.

## Timeline

* Hopefully, mid-January 2026. I will release it to public domain. Here on GitHub. It is quite done; I assure you.

Sincerely, Glen Ritchie
